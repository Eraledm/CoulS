# CoulS
CoulS is a particle simulator to help kids and students to understand the basics of Coulomb's law by watching a simulator that gives you all the information of the forces applied to each particle in a specific time.
This is a school project for the "Universidad Politécnica de San Luis Potosí" and needs to be improved... very much.
Feel free to contribute!
